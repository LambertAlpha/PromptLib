  - What each significant line or block does
  - Why certain approaches were chosen
  - How different parts connect together

  ### 3. **Key Concepts** (关键概念)
  Explain any important programming concepts, patterns, or algorithms used:
  - Data structures
  - Algorithms
  - Design patterns
  - Language-specific features

  ### 4. **Flow & Logic** (流程与逻辑)
  - Trace through the execution flow
  - Explain conditional logic and loops
  - Identify entry and exit points

  ### 5. **Dependencies & Context** (依赖与上下文)
  - What libraries or frameworks are being used?
  - What external dependencies does this code have?
  - How might this fit into a larger system?

  ### 6. **Potential Issues & Improvements** (潜在问题与改进)
